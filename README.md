# Caeser-Cipher
Python Code for encrypion and decryption of the Caeser Cipher
The following have been done in these codes:
1. Just simple encryption and decryption of caeser cipher
2. Brute Force crack which shows all the possible result
3. Brute Force Crack which choses the correct english test from the rest of the results produced
4. Frequency Analysis crack. Note that this method works when we have adequate amount of ciphertext.
